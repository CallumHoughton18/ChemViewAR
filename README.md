# ChemViewAR
A molecular viewer augmented reality android app. Designed using Unity and ARCore.

# Known Issues
* ~~Load time is a lot longer than it should be, issue arised after dropdown box implementation.~~ Resolved as of 10/09/2018
* Rotation functionality needs work, as conversion of user touch input to game world rotation could be better.
* Molecule information sheet will only be populated if the spawned molecule name matches an existing wikipedia page, so for now only the Acetone test molecule has a populated information sheet.

# To Do
* ~~Implement Molecule Info Sheet with wikipedia RESTful API implementation~~ Added as of 23/08/2018.
* ~~Unclutter UI by creating custom UI icons~~ Added as of 30/08/2018.
* ~~ Improve molecule info sheet placement and increase RESTful API call efficiency so less calls are made.~~ Added as of 30/08/2018.
* ~~Add molecular diagram to molinfo sheet.~~ Added as of 10/09/2018

* Further improve rotation functionality.
* Further improve molecule info sheet to account for space taken up by parent molecule.
* Further improve custom icon designs and make them more 'chemistry specific'. 
* Begin implementation of 'image recognition' augmented reality to spawn in 3D molecules from their skeletal diagram (possibly as separate branch).
