# ChemViewAR
A molecular viewer augmented reality android app. Designed using Unity and ARCore.

## Known Issues
* Rotation functionality needs work, as conversion of user touch input to game world rotation could be better.
* Molecule information sheet will only be populated if the spawned molecule name matches an existing wikipedia page, so for now only the Acetone test molecule has a populated information sheet.
